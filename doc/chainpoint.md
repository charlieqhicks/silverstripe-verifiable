# Chainpoint

Chainpoint is a free service offered by [Tierion](https://tierion.com/). It is a "Layer 2" system that uses the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains simply as services for anchoring arbitrary data (of a fixed length)
to.

Tierion is actually a permissionless blockchain network of its own. At time of writing it has around 5000 nodes, any one of which this module will be writing-to, and reading from.
